It was my honor and joy to work with you.\n            I truly appreciate you choosing me to guide your rehabilitation. You allowed me to achieve a personal goal\n            of small business ownership and it was quite a ride.</p>\n\n        <p>Unfortunately, due to rising costs, reduced reimbursement, and an erosion of my personal lifestyle, it was\n            unsustainable for me to continue operating in the manner that best conveyed the PACRAV brand. Additionally,\n            with my new role at Northern Nevada Medical Center, I will continue to be able to serve patients but also\n            teach and train the staff. My impact on the community with get to be twofold:\n        </p>\n        <ol>\n            <li>I can continue to treat patients</li>\n            <li>I can elevate the whole physical therapy team through education, mentorship, and training. It is an\n                exciting opportunity and I would be grateful if you would continue to consider me your primary physical\n                therapy provider.</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>I will continue to keep my previous email contact at <a href=\"mailto:matthew@pacrav.com\">matthew@pacrav.com</a> and am always available to be reached, by phone,\n            at <a href=\"tel:(610) 390-1111\">(610) 390-1111</a> to address any questions or concerns. My new contact\n            information is below. I will be working at both Northern Nevada Medical Center clinics to continue to best\n            serve everyone location needs.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"halfs\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/eo7xWKnhsf1hyk7E6\">NNMC Reno Clinic<br>\n                    1091 Steamboat Parkway, Ste 240<br>\n                    Reno, NV 89521<br></a>\n                P: <a href=\"tel:775-386-2244\">775-386-2244</a><br>\n                F: <a href=\"tel:775-335-1048\">775-335-1048</a>\n            </p>\n\n            <p><a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/8oFDCwjuDzv4wwdK9\">NNMC Sparks Clinic<br>\n                    2375 East Prater Way, Ste 301<br>\n                    Reno, NV 89434<br></a>\n                P: <a href=\"tel:775-356-4960\">775-356-4960</a><br>\n                F: <a href=\"tel:775-356-4536\">775-356-4536</a>\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>My new work email is: <a href=\"mailto:matthew.oravitz@uhsinc.com\">matthew.oravitz@uhsinc.com</a></p>\n\n        <p>As always, please do not hesitate to contact me at any time.
