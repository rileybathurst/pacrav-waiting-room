        <p>Dear Patient,</p>
        <p>I am writing this letter to inform you that I accepted a clinical leadership role at the Northern Nevada
            Medical Center and that I will be closing PACRAV Physical Therapy. It was my honor and joy to work with you.
            I truly appreciate you choosing me to guide your rehabilitation. You allowed me to achieve a personal goal
            of small business ownership and it was quite a ride.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, due to rising costs, reduced reimbursement, and an erosion of my personal lifestyle, it was
            unsustainable for me to continue operating in the manner that best conveyed the PACRAV brand. Additionally,
            with my new role at Northern Nevada Medical Center, I will continue to be able to serve patients but also
            teach and train the staff. My impact on the community with get to be twofold:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>I can continue to treat patients</li>
            <li>I can elevate the whole physical therapy team through education, mentorship, and training. It is an
                exciting opportunity and I would be grateful if you would continue to consider me your primary physical
                therapy provider.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I will continue to keep my previous email contact at <a
                href="mailto:matthew@pacrav.com">matthew@pacrav.com</a> and am always available to be reached, by phone,
            at <a href="tel:(610) 390-1111">(610) 390-1111</a> to address any questions or concerns. My new contact
            information is below. I will be working at both Northern Nevada Medical Center clinics to continue to best
            serve everyone location needs.</p>
